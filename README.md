# Movie_Project

This app was build to have not a very pleasant looking UI but for implmenting multi-level user system i.e.
Admin,Employee,User.

This app shows you a list of movies that can be searched which then upon clicking shows more details about the movie.
App can also replicate an act of addign the movie to the favourites or an acton of renting the movie.

The app uses OMDB api to pull json data for the movie that is being seached and then parses that data and show the final results to the user. 

For searching the movie
This app uses firebase for basic Functionality of storing the data in the firestore database, and the authentication is done via email and passsword.

To have access to user account an account must be created 
or you can use the below combination

Email :- user@user.com
password :- user1234

For admin access below is the userid and password as more admin can only be created by me ;-)

Email :- 085.jay@gmail.com
password :- admin1234

For employees you will need to create an employee by loging into the admin account.
